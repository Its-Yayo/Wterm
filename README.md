# Wterm
Wterm is a simple CLI tool to calculate a reversible and irreversible process written in Python. It's mainly developed for
thermodinamics purposes and it's under the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) license. 

You must have all these dependencies to run Wterm successfully. 

```shell
$ pip install matplotlib numpy math argparse plotly
```

## Basics
We can remember the basic 3 lays of thermodinamics. 
- 1st Law: Energy can't be created or destroyed. It's mainly refered as "the conservation of energy". 
- 2nd Law: The entropy of the universe increases if there's an spontaneous process. 
- 3rd Law: A perfect crystal with 0 K, has cero entropy. 

In thermodinamics, a reversible process is when there's an environment and it's system that can return to the exact state it was or they were in. An irreversible process is the opposite one. It can't be returned to the original state or to the exact states they were in. 

Wterm has an optimization from a previous project with args as key and values from the CLI. Project still in development.

## Usage
Soon...

This is a special project, since it is modified from a previous assignment I did with a trully special person. ðŸŒ·
